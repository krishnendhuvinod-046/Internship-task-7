## Task 7: SQLite Sales Analysis with Python
## 📌 Overview
This project is part of the Data Analyst Internship tasks. The objective is to connect Python to a SQLite database, perform data aggregation using SQL, and visualize the sales revenue using a bar chart.



## 🛠️ Tools Used
Python (Scripting)


SQLite3 (Database Management) 


Pandas (Data Manipulation) 


Matplotlib (Data Visualization) 

## 📂 Files in this Repository
analysis.py: The main Python script that connects to the database, runs queries, and generates the chart.

create_db.py: A helper script used to generate the dummy sales_data.db file.

sales_data.db: The SQLite database file containing the sales table.

sales_chart.png: The output bar chart generated by the script.

## 📊 Methodology

Database Connection: Used the sqlite3 library to establish a connection to sales_data.db.

SQL Query: Executed a SQL query to calculate total quantity and total revenue:

Used SUM(quantity) to get total units sold.

Used SUM(quantity * price) to calculate revenue.

Used GROUP BY product to categorize the data by product name.


Data Processing: Loaded the SQL query results directly into a Pandas DataFrame for easier handling.


Visualization: Created a bar chart using Matplotlib to compare revenue across different products.

## 📈 Output
Below is the visual representation of the sales revenue generated by the script:
